# App Development Project
In this project, I hypothetically worked as a data analyst for an app developer, with the aim of providing data driven insights to make an informed recommendations on what kind of app to build. 
In order to do so, I did some data exploration and data analysis in SQL, to identify key features of success app (app with high ratings). 

Questions to be be explored were:
- What categories are most popular?
- How should the app be priced? 
- How can the app maximise user rating?
